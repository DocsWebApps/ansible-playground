# Welcome to Doc's Ansible Playground
The aim of this project is to create an Ansible playground that can be utilised to learn Ansible on a single machine that has Docker installed.

The way this works is that a virutal network of individual servers is created as Docker containers on a single server. A single Ansible server is created and then as manay clients as you need. You can then play with the Ansible server configuring your virtual clients as web servers, database servers etc. for the purpose of mastering Ansible.

Enjoy !
